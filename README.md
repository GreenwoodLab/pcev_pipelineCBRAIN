## Descrition of PCEV

Principal component of explained variance (PCEV) is a statistical tool for the analysis of a multivariate response vector. It is a dimension-reduction technique, similar to Principal component analysis (PCA), which seeks to maximize the proportion of variance (in the response vector) being explained by a set of covariates.
